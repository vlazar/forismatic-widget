A W3C Widget?
-------------

[W3C widgets](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets) are client-side applications that are authored using Web standards, but whose content can also be embedded into Web documents. Widgets already supported on different platforms:

* [Opera for PC, Mac & Linux](http://www.opera.com/browser)
* [Opera for phones](http://www.opera.com/mobile)
* [Opera/T-Mobile Widget Manager](http://www.t-mobile.net)
* [Android Vodafone Apps Manager](https://developer.vodafone.com/android-widget-manager)
* [Symbian S60 Vodafone Apps Manager](https://developer.vodafone.com/symbian-widget-manager)
* [Samsung Bada](http://www.bada.com)
* Nokia Web Runtime Widgets
* And more to come...

What it practically means is that the same code can work just fine in Web, on desktops (Windows, Linux and OSX) and many mobile platforms without any modifications.

Suported platforms
------------------
Forismatic widget currently works in Opera (more platforms to be tested/supported soon).
